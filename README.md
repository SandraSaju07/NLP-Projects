## 📝 Overview

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. This repository demonstrates various NLP projects, ranging from text processing and sentiment analysis to more advanced tasks like chatbots and language models.

Key areas covered:
- Text Preprocessing (Tokenization, Stop Words Removal, Lemmatization)
- Sentiment Analysis
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Text Classification
- Chatbots
- Language Modeling and Generation
- Transformer Models (BERT, GPT)
